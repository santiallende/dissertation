  abstract = "Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is
              an important feature of major depressive disorder (MDD), but
              relatively little attention has been given to within-person
              variability of hormone secretion over time. Because most studies
              have been conducted in hospital settings, little information is
              available about naturally occurring patterns of cortisol
              secretion throughout the day in depressed outpatients. Multiple
              salivary cortisol samples were obtained over a 6-day period from
              47 outpatients with MDD and 39 healthy controls in their everyday
              environment. We used multilevel regression analysis to estimate
              the effects of MDD and associated clinical characteristics on
              cortisol levels and intraindividual variability. Although more
              severe symptoms were associated with small elevations in cortisol
              levels, we found no clear evidence for hypercortisolism in the
              MDD group as a whole. However, cortisol output in MDD outpatients
              was less stable from sample to sample, as evidenced by a
              significantly lower autocorrelation than that observed in
              controls. Secretory patterns were particularly erratic in
              patients with more severe or recurrent episodes. Findings suggest
              that erratic cortisol secretion may be a more characteristic
              feature of HPA axis dysregulation in MDD than hypercortisolism,

              distress and a six-question short-form scale embedded within the
              10-question scale were developed for the redesigned US National
              Health Interview Survey (NHIS). METHODS: Initial pilot questions
              were administered in a US national mail survey (N = 1401). A
              reduced set of questions was subsequently administered in a US
              national telephone survey (N = 1574). The 10-question and
              six-question scales, which we refer to as the K10 and K6, were
              constructed from the reduced set of questions based on Item
              Response Theory models. The scales were subsequently validated in
              a two-stage clinical reappraisal survey (N = 1000 telephone
              screening interviews in the first stage followed by N = 153
              face-to-face clinical interviews in the second stage that
              oversampled first-stage respondents who screened positive for
              emotional problems) in a local convenience sample. The
              second-stage sample was administered the screening scales along
              with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). The K6
              was subsequently included in the 1997 (N = 36116) and 1998 (N =
              32440) US National Health Interview Survey, while the K10 was
              included in the 1997 (N = 10641) Australian National Survey of
              Mental Health and Well-Being. RESULTS: Both the K10 and K6 have
              good precision in the 90th-99th percentile range of the
              population distribution (standard errors of standardized scores
              in the range 0.20-0.25) as well as consistent psychometric
              properties across major sociodemographic subsamples. The scales
              strongly discriminate between community cases and non-cases of
              DSM-IV/SCID disorders, with areas under the Receiver Operating
              Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.87-0.88 for disorders having
              Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores of 0-70 and
              0.95-0.96 for disorders having GAF scores of 0-50. CONCLUSIONS:
              The brevity, strong psychometric properties, and ability to
              discriminate DSM-IV cases from non-cases make the K10 and K6
              attractive for use in general-purpose health surveys. The scales
              are already being used in annual government health surveys in the
              US and Canada as well as in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys.
              Routine inclusion of either the K10 or K6 in clinical studies
              would create an important, and heretofore missing, crosswalk
              between community and clinical epidemiology.",

              multiple stressors on 11 percent of the study days. The most
              common class of stressors was interpersonal tension followed by
              work-related stressors for men and network stressors (events that
              occur to close others) for women. Stressors that involved danger

              cortisol secretion, during depressive and manic episodes. It is
              less clear whether these abnormalities persist after symptomatic
              recovery. In the present study we used the experience sampling
              method with intensive salivary cortisol sampling to study
              patterns of cortisol secretion in relation to negative and
              positive daily events during the normal daily life of a group of
              36 patients with remitted bipolar disorder and 38 healthy
              controls. Results of multilevel regression analysis indicated
              that daytime cortisol levels and reactivity to daily events were
              similar in remitted bipolar patients and healthy controls, but
              bipolar patients showed flatter diurnal slopes and larger
              cortisol fluctuations over successive measures. Patients with
              many previous episodes had higher overall cortisol levels,
              reduced cortisol reactivity to negative daily events, and flatter
              diurnal slopes than patients with fewer episodes. These results
              provide additional evidence of subtle HPA axis dysregulation in
              remitted bipolar patients, especially in those with many
              recurrent episodes.",
