Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h1><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h1>
<p>The hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is intricately associated with psychological and physical health. Psychological outcomes linked to faulty HPA-axis function include chronic fatigue syndrome, burnout syndrome, sleep disorders, suicide risk, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Physical outcomes associated with faulty HPA-axis function include tumor progression, cancer survival, congestive heart failure, hypertension, obesity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function is commonly measured via cortisol, a glucocorticoid steroid hormone, which is critical to the function of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine and nervous systems.</p>
<p>In field research, cortisol is assayed from saliva, which is reliably correlated with free, unbound plasma cortisol. Endogenous cortisol exhibits two distinct rhythms: (1) a circadian ryhthm, which peaks 30-minutes post-wake and reaches a nadir at night and (2) an ultradian rhythm, which peaks approximately once per hour. Three commonly derived measures of diurnal salivary cortisol include: (1) the cortisol awakening response, (2) diurnal salivary cortisol slope and (3) area under the curve. However, a seldom examined measure of salivary cortisol that may provide unique information is cortisol intraindividual secretory variability (cIIV).</p>
<p>Cortisol intraindividual secretory variability has only been examined in the context of depressive and bipolar disorders. Studies have yet to examine cIIV in nonclinical affect presentations. Thus, the primary aim of the present study was to examine whether cIIV is associated with global and daily measures of positive and negative affect in a nonclinical sample. A secondary exploratory aim of the present study was to examine whether person-level profiles of salivary cortisol measures, including the CAR, AUC, DCS and cIIV, are associated with positive and negative affect.</p>

<h1><strong>LITERATURE REVIEW</strong></h1>
<div id="salivary-cortisol-measures" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h2>
<p>Three salivary cortisol measures are frequently used in field research: (1) the cortisol awakening response (CAR), (2) area under the curve (AUC) and (3) diurnal cortisol slope (DCS) <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. Each measure captures a distinct aspect of HPA axis function. Below is a methodologically focused overview of each measure, with a particular focus on DCS.</p>
<div id="cortisol-awakening-response" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Cortisol Awakening Response</strong></h3>
<p>The cortisol awakening response (CAR) is characterized by an increase in cortisol 30-45 minutes post-wake and represents a physiological reaction to awakening (i.e., a reactivity index) <span class="citation">(Pruessner et al. 1997; Stalder et al. 2016)</span>. The CAR is calculated by subtracting the initial wake sample from the 30-45 minute post-wake sample or by computing the ratio between the two morning samples <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. Area under the curve with respect to increase is advised in study designs that have a high morning sampling rate <span class="citation">(Fekedulegn et al. 2007)</span>.</p>
<p>The “boost” hypothesis suggests that the CAR represents an anticipation of perceived daily stress; indeed, the CAR is more pronounced on weekdays than on weekends <span class="citation">(Schlotz et al. 2004; Adam et al. 2006)</span>. A greater CAR is also observed on high stressor days versus low stressor days <span class="citation">(Almeida, Piazza, and Stawski 2009)</span> and when awakening in the light versus when awakening in the dark <span class="citation">(Figueiro et al. 2013)</span>. Last, the CAR is frequently associated with physical and mental health outcomes, with the most consistent association between a reduced CAR and posttraumatic stress disorder <span class="citation">(Chida and Steptoe 2009)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="area-under-the-curve" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Area Under the Curve</strong></h3>
<p>Area under the curve has two orthogonal derivations that account for intensity and sensitivity: (1) area under the curve with respect to ground (<span class="math inline">\(AUC_G\)</span>) and (2) area under the curve with respect to increase (<span class="math inline">\(AUC_I\)</span>), with <span class="math inline">\(AUC_G\)</span> more readily used <span class="citation">(Fekedulegn et al. 2007)</span>. The 30-45 minute post-wake sample is inconsistently removed from the calculations to avoid modeling the CAR <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. While <span class="math inline">\(AUC_G\)</span> is a better indicator of total daily cortisol output (i.e, intensity), <span class="math inline">\(AUC_I\)</span> is a better indicator of diurnal rate of change (i.e., sensitivity) <span class="citation">(Fekedulegn et al. 2007)</span>. Greater <span class="math inline">\(AUC_G\)</span> is linked to experiencing more stress than usual in nonclinical populations <span class="citation">(Stawski et al. 2013)</span> but is not linked to shorter survival in cancer populations <span class="citation">(Sephton et al. 2000, 2013)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="diurnal-cortisol-slope-modeling-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Diurnal Cortisol Slope Modeling Procedures</strong></h3>
<p>Diurnal cortisol slope, defined as the time period between the morning and bedtime samples, is a strong indicator of diurnal change <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. A normative diurnal rhythm is characterized by a negative slope coefficient <span class="citation">(Stone et al. 2001)</span>. To correct for a positively skewed distribution, the natural logarithm of salivary cortisol is computed prior to deriving slope coefficients <span class="citation">(Kraemer et al. 2006)</span>. Last, research protocols generally sample 5 times per day for a minimum of two days to estimate reliable DCS estimates <span class="citation">(Kraemer et al. 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>Currently, four methods exist to examine diurnal cortisol slopes. In the first method, end-of-day bedtime levels are subtracted from initial wake levels <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. In the second method, the difference between the wake and bedtime samples is divided by the time interval between them <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>. In the third method, an ordinary least squares (OLS) slopes-as-outcomes approach is used, where log-transformed cortisol values are either regressed on time-of-day continuously across days or regressed separately for each day with daily coefficients averaged together <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009; Giese-Davis et al. 2004; Smyth et al. 1997)</span>. In the fourth method, variance components models (i.e., linear mixed models) are used to partition and explain moment-level (individual collection times, level 1), day level (day-to-day, level 2) and participant level (between-participant, level 3) sources of variance <span class="citation">(Hruschka, Kohrt, and Worthman 2005; Adam and Kumari 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>In methods three and four, slopes are anchored at wake or at wake +30 at the discretion of the researcher, although anchoring at wake is advised more frequently <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009; Kraemer et al. 2006)</span>. If slopes are anchored at wake, the wake +30 sample is commonly removed to avoid modeling the CAR <span class="citation">(Adam and Kumari 2009; Kraemer et al. 2006)</span>. With adequate sample sizes, piecewise and quadratic multilevel approaches are used to simultaneously model the CAR and the DCS <span class="citation">(Adam et al. 2006; Karlamangla et al. 2013)</span>. Recently, variance components models have become preferred over OLS slopes-as-outcomes approaches. The slopes-as-outcomes approach has been scrutinized as less reliable due to: (1) using fewer than 30 measurements per individual regression, (2) in subsequent analyses, failing to account for error associated with prior person-specific regression models and (3) not adequately accounting for missing data <span class="citation">(Hoffman 2015)</span>. On the other hand, variance components models allow researchers to test for sources of dependency in the response variable, partition that variance accordingly, test predictors against appropriate source(s) of variance and compute relevant effect sizes (e.g., pseudo-<span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>) <span class="citation">(Snijders and Bosker 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>In the context of salivary cortisol, variance components models test for and explain within-day, day-to-day and between-participant sources of variance. Partitioning variance in the response variable (cortisol) is used to distinguish between moment-level predictors whose sampling rates match that of the cortisol sampling rate (e.g., time-since-waking); day-level predictors with a sampling rate of once per day (e.g., daily mood); and participant-level predictors computed or observed with sampling rates of once per the duration of the study. Participant-level predictors specifically account for individual differences in cortisol values (e.g., marital status). Although some studies have found DCS to be relatively stable across days <span class="citation">(Kraemer et al. 2006; Segerstrom, Sephton, and Westgate 2017)</span>, others have found DCS to not only vary across days but also for resulting sources of variability to be associated with targeted variables <span class="citation">(Abercrombie et al. 2004; Adam et al. 2006; Dmitrieva et al. 2013; Hruschka, Kohrt, and Worthman 2005; Karlamangla et al. 2013; Ross et al. 2014; Segerstrom, Sephton, and Westgate 2017, 2017; Sin et al. 2017; Stone et al. 2001)</span>.</p>

<h3><strong>Diurnal Cortisol Slope and Health Outcomes</strong></h3>
<p>Diurnal cortisol slope has received considerable attention across a range of physical and mental health presentations. Prior studies have examined between-participant DCS variation in depressive disorders, fatigue, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, elevated body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular disease and cancer populations. All above presentations, with the exception of anxiety disorders, which evidence a precipitous diurnal decline, are associated with a flattened diurnal rhythm.</p>
<p>A substantial body of literature has investigated the link between DCS and depression. Results on DCS and depression are inconsistent, with some studies reporting a flattened diurnal rhythm <span class="citation">(Weinrib et al. 2010; Jarcho et al. 2013; Gold et al. 2009; Gallagher-Thompson et al. 2006)</span> and others reporting null or opposing results <span class="citation">(Veen et al. 2011; Ho et al. 2013; Hsiao et al. 2010; Vammen et al. 2014)</span>. Heterogeneous results may be due to a variety of factors, including depressive subtypes, variable collection times, psychiatric comorbidities, age, medication use, menstruation timing and the derivation of slopes <span class="citation">(Jarcho et al. 2013)</span>. In light of these discrepant results, it is hypothesized that since positive affect, but not negative affect, exhibits a diurnal pattern, positive affect may be entrained to the diurnal variation of cortisol <span class="citation">(Miller et al. 2015, 2016)</span>. Thus, it may be that low positive, rather than high negative affect, primarily drives the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation and depression <span class="citation">(Miller et al. 2015, 2016)</span>.</p>
<p>In both clinical and non-clinical samples, fatigue is associated with a flattened DCS, possibly due to the presence of abnormally low waking cortisol levels <span class="citation">(Kumari et al. 2009; Bower et al. 2005)</span>. Since posttraumatic stress disorder is marked by hypo-activation of the HPA axis <span class="citation">(Yehuda et al. 1990)</span>, diurnal decline is typically low and blunted <span class="citation">(Yehuda, Golier, and Kaufman 2005)</span>. Somewhat of an anomaly, anxiety disorders are associated with a precipitous diurnal decline, which may be due to abnormally elevated morning cortisol levels <span class="citation">(Packard, Egan, and Ulrich-Lai 2011)</span>.</p>
<p>A positive association between BMI and DCS exists, which may be related to the excitatory function of cortisol in metabolic processes <span class="citation">(Rodriguez et al. 2015)</span>. With regard to cardiovascular disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients with flattened diurnal rhythms are at greater risk for major adverse cardiac events and death <span class="citation">(Ronaldson et al. 2015)</span>. A particularly robust finding exists between flattened diurnal cortisol rhythms and cancer mortality <span class="citation">(Schrepf et al. 2013; Sephton et al. 2000, 2013; Weinrib et al. 2010)</span>. It is hypothesized that cancer-related inflammatory processes and associated depressive presentations may explain the link between flattened rhythms and earlier mortality <span class="citation">(Sephton et al. 2009)</span>.</p>
<p>A less examined but important item for research is to better understand how patterns of individual samples, namely waking and bedtime samples, influence diurnal salivary cortisol variation <span class="citation">(Adam et al. 2017)</span>. A recent study based on metastatic breast cancer patients found that waking cortisol levels were only 48% accurate in predicting flat versus steep diurnal rhythms, while 2100h cortisol levels were 86% accurate in predicting flat versus steep diurnal rhythms <span class="citation">(Allende et al. 2020)</span>. Interestingly, with regard to associations with health outcomes, a recent meta-analysis found that morning and bedtime cortisol levels were similarly associated with poor health outcomes but that morning cortisol levels were more likely to be associated with positive health outcomes <span class="citation">(Caulfield, Sonia, and others 2019)</span>. Moreover, while the salivary cortisol rhythm is purported to be a reliable measure of the underlying 24-hour plasma rhythm, a few studies based on metastatic breast cancer patients have failed to show that a disrupted circadian rhythm in total plasma cortisol underlies flattened salivary cortisol rhythms <span class="citation">(Zeitzer et al. 2014, 2016)</span>. In sum, further research is needed to better understand the physiological pathway of flattened diurnal salivary cortisol rhythms.</p>

<div id="age-and-gender-differences-in-measures-of-salivary-cortisol" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Age and Gender Differences in Measures of Salivary Cortisol</strong></h3>
<p>Notable age and gender differences exist in associations between affect and HPA axis regulation. For example, lower waking cortisol is observed in females who report greater state positive affect (PA) but not in males who report greater state PA <span class="citation">(Polk et al. 2005)</span>. Also, for participants who report high trait PA, women express lower cortisol concentrations than men until 1600h <span class="citation">(Polk et al. 2005)</span>. In contrast, for participants who report low trait PA, men express higher concentrations of cortisol than women after 1200h <span class="citation">(Polk et al. 2005)</span>. Moreover, lower trait negative affect (NA) is associated with a blunted CAR in men but not in women. In contrast, state NA is not associated with gender differences in the CAR <span class="citation">(Polk et al. 2005)</span>. Together, age and NA have deleterious effects on HPA axis function. For example, exaggerated total daily cortisol output in response to elevated daily NA is only observed in adults greater than 50 years-of-age <span class="citation">(Piazza et al. 2013)</span>. Similarly, older adults exhibit higher evening cortisol levels in response to low-to-moderate daily NA, while younger adults do not <span class="citation">(Piazza et al. 2013)</span>.</p>

Apropos DCS, although some studies have reported a steeper diurnal curve in response to higher trait PA <span class="citation">(Hoyt et al. 2015; Miller et al. 2016)</span>, null results have also been reported <span class="citation">(Brummett et al. 2009; Sin et al. 2017)</span>. Methodological differences related to the operationalization of affect (e.g., low arousal. vs high arousal PA) likely contribute to divergent results. Of note, one study found that the association between high arousal PA and a steeper diurnal decline is likely due to lower bedtime cortisol levels <span class="citation">(Hoyt et al. 2015)</span>.</p>

<h3><strong>Global Negative Affect and Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h3>
<p>In a similar vein, a tenuous relationship exists between NA and HPA axis regulation in non-clinical populations. As described above, NA is associated with a greater CAR and a greater AUC in men but not in women <span class="citation">(Polk et al. 2005)</span>. Further, while both low and high arousal NA are associated with lower waking cortisol levels, only low arousal NA is associated with a blunted DCS <span class="citation">(Hoyt et al. 2015)</span>. On the other hand, others have reported null results for associations between NA and diurnal cortisol measures <span class="citation">(Miller et al. 2016; Nater, Hoppmann, and Klumb 2010)</span>.

<h3><strong>Basic Emotions and Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h3>
<p>The study of basic emotions may help to disentangle the discrepant results found in global measures of PA and NA. For example, one study found a series of revealing results: (1) a composite measure of loneliness, sadness and overwhelm was positively associated with the CAR, (2) a composite measure of anger and tension was positively associated with DCS, and (3) fatigue was negatively associated with lower waking cortisol levels [Adam:2006hr]. However, a composite measure of feeling active/effective and confident/confused/forgetful was not associated with any measures of cortisol [Adam:2006hr]. Another study found that optimism is associated with decreased waking and daily cortisol levels in men but not in women <span class="citation">(Dockray and Steptoe 2010)</span>. Further, happiness is associated with elevated morning cortisol levels and a higher CAR <span class="citation">(Steptoe et al. 2007)</span> as well as greater weekday-weekend CAR flexibility <span class="citation">(Mikolajczak et al. 2010)</span>. Laboratory studies designed to induce acute stress have found shame, decreased self-esteem and fear to be associated with heightened HPA axis activity <span class="citation">(Denson, Spanovic, and Miller 2009; Dickerson and Kemeny 2004; Kemeny, Gruenewald, and Dickerson 2004; Lerner et al. 2007)</span> and anger and disgust to be associated with decreased HPA axis activity <span class="citation">(Lerner et al. 2007)</span>.</p>

<h3><strong>Day-to-Day Dynamics of Affect and Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h3>
<p>With regard to temporal precedence, a day-to-day analysis of basic emotions and measures of diurnal cortisol was particularly telling. First, elevated prior-day scores on a composite measure of loneliness, sadness and overwhelm predicted a greater CAR, but an increased CAR did not predict subsequent daily scores on the same composite measure [Adam:2006hr]. Second, elevated waking cortisol levels predicted subsequent daily scores on a composite measure of fatigue and related physical symptoms, but prior-day scores on the same composite measure did not predict waking cortisol levels [Adam:2006hr]. Third, a composite measure of tension and anger predicted flatter same-day DCS, but prior-day tension and anger did not predict DCS. Interestingly, the same-day tension/anger and DCS finding was due to elevated evening cortisol levels, rather than lower morning cortisol levels [Adam:2006hr].</p>

<div id="emotion-regulation-strategies-and-salivary-cortisol-measures" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Emotion Regulation Strategies and Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h3>
<p>Among commonly studied emotion regulation strategies, emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, repressive-defensiveness, emotional expressivity and mindfulness have been examined in the salivary cortisol literature. In nonclinical samples, emotional suppression is linked to a steeper CAR and a flatter DCS but is not linked to AUCg <span class="citation">(Otto et al. 2018)</span>. Interestingly, self-report reappraisal is not associated with any measures of diurnal cortisol <span class="citation">(Otto et al. 2018)</span>. Moreover, in laboratory-induced stress paradigms, both reappraisal and emotional suppression are associated with increased activation of the HPA axis <span class="citation">(Denson et al. 2014; Lam et al. 2009)</span>. In metastatic breast cancer patients, lower repressive-defensiveness, a construct related to emotional suppression, is associated with a steeper diurnal decline <span class="citation">(Giese-Davis et al. 2006)</span>. In supportive-expressive group therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients, greater expression of NA is related to a steeper diurnal decline <span class="citation">(Giese-Davis et al. 2006)</span>. Mindfulness interventions demonstrate mixed results. Some studies report null effects of mindfulness interventions on the CAR, DCS, and on laboratory-induced cortisol reactivity <span class="citation">(Beddig et al. 2020; Gex-Fabry et al. 2012; Engert et al. 2017)</span>, while other studies report improved HPA axis activity <span class="citation">(Fan, Tang, and Posner 2014; Tang et al. 2007)</span>.

<h3><strong>Affect Intraindividual Variability and Salivary Cortisol Measures</strong></h3>
<p>A nascent body of literature is investigating the effects of affect intraindividual variability on salivary cortisol measures.

<h2><strong>Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Function</strong></h2>
<div id="cortisol-secretion-pathway" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Cortisol Secretion Pathway</strong></h3>
<p>The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, a structure parallel to the third ventricle, initiates the downstream secretion of cortisol <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. Hypophysiotropic neurons in the PVN project their axons to the median eminence and, when sufficiently activated, the median eminence releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. The hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system ends in the anterior pituitary, where corticotrophs, cells of the anterior pituitary, respond to CRH by synthesizing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the precursor hormone, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. Once secreted into the bloodstream, ACTH binds to adrenocortical ACTH receptors (MC2R) in the cells of the zona fasciculata, increases cholesterol availability and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of cortisol <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. The HPA axis self-regulates, in part, by negative feedback, whereby cortisol molecules cross the blood-brain barrier, bind to glucocorticoid receptors in the hypothalamus and act to either increase or decrease the discharge of CRH and ACTH <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. In doing so, cortisol either inhibits or propagates its own downstream synthesis and the downstream synthesis of epinephrine and norepinephrine <span class="citation">(Geer 2016)</span>. Thus, cortisol-induced negative feedback in the hypothalamus is a primary mechanism by which the fight or flight response is deactivated.</p>

<div id="circadian-oscillations-related-to-hpa-axis-function" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Circadian Oscillations Related to HPA Axis Function</strong></h3>
<p>The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the chief circadian pacemaker, alters cellular activity in response to the day-night cycle <span class="citation">(Foster and Kreitzman 2017)</span>. It is a constituent of the hypothalamic nuclei and is superior to the optic chiasm <span class="citation">(Netter 2014)</span>. The SCN is connected to the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract, whereby melanopsin, a photopigment expressed by photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, entrains the SCN and its slave oscillatiors, including the PVN <span class="citation">(Foster and Kreitzman 2017)</span>. In this way, the SCN initiates the downstream synthesis of ACTH and cortisol, which express similar diurnal rhythms <span class="citation">(Young, Carlson, and Brown 2001)</span>. The diurnal rhythm of cortisol is marked by a nadir at midnight, a peak 30-minutes post-wake and a gradual decline thereafter <span class="citation">(Kirschbaum and Hellhammer 1989)</span>.

<div id="ultradian-oscillations-related-to-hpa-axis-function" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Ultradian Oscillations Related to HPA Axis Function</strong></h3>
<p>The ultradian rhythm, which peaks approximately once per hour, is the pulsatile pattern that underlies the circadian cortisol cycle <span class="citation">(Jasper and Engeland 1991; Lightman and Conway-Campbell 2010)</span>. Importantly, the ultradian cycle is not a product of the SCN, as animal studies have shown that the ultradian rhythm remains intact when the SCN is removed <span class="citation">(Waite et al. 2012)</span>. However, when the SCN is intact, a decrease in ultradian amplitude occurs from dawn to midnight <span class="citation">(Jasper and Engeland 1991; Windle et al. 1998; Nielsen, Laz, and Lauritzen 2017; Waite et al. 2012; Brown, Meehan, and Dempster 2001)</span>. While a physiological pulse generator, per se, has not been discovered <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004)</span>, computational models suggest that time delays in the feedforward-feedback process of the HPA axis generate observed cortisol pulsatility <span class="citation">(Gjerstad, Lightman, and Spiga 2018; Walker, Terry, and Lightman 2010)</span>. In the feedforward component of the process, ACTH catalyzes the synthesis of cortisol in the zona fasciculata and a time delay occurs due to the lipid solubility of cortisol and due to its de novo synthesis <span class="citation">(Gjerstad, Lightman, and Spiga 2018; Walker, Terry, and Lightman 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>In the feedback component of the process, unbound cortisol crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors and, via its effect on GRs, inhibits the production of CRH and ACTH <span class="citation">(Conrad et al. 2009; Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004)</span>. That is, while research suggests involvement of GRs in negative feedback signaling and in producing a delay, MRs may be less important in negative feedback <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004; Karssen et al. 2001)</span>. The diminished role of MRs may be due to their low saturation threshold and to the poor transportation of low levels of cortisol by P-glycoprotein <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004; Karssen et al. 2001)</span>. Moreover, whereas GRs are primarily expressed in the hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and paraventricular nucleus, MRs are primarily expressed in the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex <span class="citation">(Reul and Kloet 1985; Reul and De Kloet 1986)</span>.</p>
<p>In brief, GRs are primarily activated during the rise or peak of an ultradian cycle (i.e., feedforward component), perhaps in response to stress, or during the rise or peak of the circadian cycle, while MRs are additionally activated during the fall or nadir of an ultradian cycle (i.e., feedback component) or during the fall or nadir of the circadian cycle <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004; Conway-Campbell et al. 2007; Kitchener et al. 2004; Reul and Kloet 1985; Reul et al. 1990; Spencer et al. 1993; Gjerstad, Lightman, and Spiga 2018; Nielsen, Laz, and Lauritzen 2017)</span>.</p>

The adrenal medulla is responsible for synthesizing hormones that produce the fight or flight response, namely epinephrine and norepinephrine <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>. The adrenal cortex is responsible for synthesizing a host of different steroid hormones, collectively known as corticosteroids <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>.

The cells of the zona glomerulosa, the outer region of the adrenal cortex, produce a corticosteroid known as aldosterone, which is important in fluid retention <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>. The cells of the zona fasciculata, the middle region of the adrenal cortex, produce glucocorticoid steroids such as cortisol <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>.

<div id="synthesis-of-cortisol" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Synthesis of Cortisol</strong></h3>
<p>Corticosteroids are synthesized from cholesterol, which is a sterol molecule consisting of a core steroid structure <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>. Cells of the zona fasciculata derive cholesterol by either de novo synthesis or, more commonly, recruit it from low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the bloodstream <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>. Once cholesterol is made available, it is converted into pregnenolone by the cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, also known as P450 11A1 <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. Afterward, 17<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-hydroxylase is used to convert pregnenolone into 17<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-hydroxypregnenolone <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>.

Finally, 21-hydroxylase is used to convert 17<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-hydroxyprogesterone into 11-deoxycortisol, which is then converted into cortisol via 11<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-hydroxylase <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>.

<h3><strong>Interaction Between Cortisol and Peripheral Cells</strong></h3>
<p>At peripheral sites, lipid soluble cortisol molecules cross cell membranes, bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm and initiate a pathway to change gene expression and cell behavior <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. In the cytoplasm, glucocorticoid receptors are initially bound to proteins (e.g., HSP90) that prevent them from entering the nucleus of cells <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. However, once cortisol molecules bind to GRs, the proteins break away, leaving cortisol-receptor complexes that are capable of entering the nucleus <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. In the nucleus, cortisol-receptor complexes form homodimers, specific transcription factors, that bind to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) in the gene control region of specific genes <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>.

<h2><strong>Cortisol and the Metabolic System</strong></h2>
<div id="metabolic-homeostasis" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Metabolic Homeostasis</strong></h3>
<p>The liver is the main driver of metabolic homeostasis. It performs two functions, glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis, that maintain adequate fasting blood glucose levels. In adults, normative fasting blood glucose levels range from 80 mg/dL to 120 mg/dL <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. During the fasting state, glycogenosis occurs, whereby glycogen polymers stored in the cells of the liver, called hepatocytes, are broken down and gradually released into the bloodstream <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. Then, during the fed state, hepatocytes rebuild glycogen polymers by recruiting glucose from the bloodstream <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. In gluconeogenesis, hepatocytes convert blood-bound amino acids into glucose, which is subsequently circulated through the bloodstream <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>A dynamic relationship between two hormones, insulin and glucagon, during the fasting-fed cycle triggers glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. During the fasting state, insulin levels are low, while glucagon levels are high <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. In contrast, during the fed state, insulin levels are high, while glucagon levels are low <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. In the fasting state, high glucagon levels without high insulin levels, triggers glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis, which increases blood glucose levels <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. In the fed state, high insulin levels inhibit the glucagon signal that triggers hepatocytes to perform glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. Interestingly, fasting hyperglycemia, as is found in diabetes mellitus, is caused by maladaptive insulin signaling, which results in glucagon overstimulating hepatocytes to engage in glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>.</p>
<p>In addition to inhibiting the glucagon signal, insulin also initiates proteolysis in skeletal muscle cells <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. Specifically, low insulin concentrations catalyze proteolysis, which increases amino acid concentrations for use in gluconeogenesis <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. Similarly, low insulin concentrations catalyze lipolysis, whereby adipocytes, cells of adipose tissue, break down triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFAs) <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>. Resulting free fatty acids are then circulated around the bloodstream via the transport protein, albumin, and are used as an energy source by muscle tissues such as the cardiac muscle <span class="citation">(Van den Berghe 1991)</span>.</p>

<h3><strong>Effects of Cortisol on the Metabolic System</strong></h3>
<p>Elevated cortisol levels increase metabolic activity by binding to GRs in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and initiating glycogenosis and gluconeogenesis <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. As a result, hepatocytes secrete more glucose than peripheral tissues require, which can induce hyperglycemia and insulin resistance <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. Cortisol molecules also stimulate gluconeogenesis because they encourage skeletal muscle cells to engage in proteolysis <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. In addition, cortisol molecules stimulate lipolysis and the secretion of FFAs by binding to GRs in the cytoplasm of adipocytes <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>. In sum, cortisol increases blood glucose, amino acid and FFA concentrations <span class="citation">(Melmed et al. 2015)</span>.</p>

<h2><strong>Cortisol and the Immune System</strong></h2>
<div id="function-of-the-immune-system" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Function of the Immune System</strong></h3>
<p>The immune system is responsible for disarming pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. The immune system comprises the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. The innate immune system is characterized by a singular inflammatory response to pathogens, while the adaptive immune system is characterized by its ability to vary its response to different types of pathogens <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>In the innate immune system, two sentinel cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, monitor local tissue for pathogens <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. They do so via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. If PAMPs are identified, macrophages and dendritic cells initiate the inflammatory response by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have two primary functions in the innate immune system <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. First, they cause arterial vasodilation and endothelial contraction, which produce inflammatory exudate and fend off pathogens <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. Second, they encourage the recruitment of two leukocytes, neutrophils and macrophages, that phagocytosize pathogens <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. Of note, pro-inflammatory cytokines need to be continuously produced to maintain the inflammatory response <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>The adaptive immune system is further divided into two branches, the humoral adaptive immune response and the cell mediated adaptive immune response, which target extracellular and intracellular pathogens, respectively <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. The humoral adaptive immune response activates helper T cells (CD4+), which target specific pathogenic antigens, and B cells, which produce targeted antibodies <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. The cell mediated immune response activates cytotoxic T cells (CD8+), which target and destroy infected human cells <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>. Similar to pro-inflammatory cytokines, T cells need to be continuously activated to fend off pathogens <span class="citation">(Johnson 2012)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="effects-of-cortisol-on-the-immune-system" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Effects of Cortisol on the Immune System</strong></h3>
<p>In non-pathological conditions, cortisol dampens the function of the immune system and prevents tissue damage <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. Cortisol has an anti-inflammatory effect because it inhibits the innate immune system and an immunosuppressive effect because it inhibits the adaptive immune system <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. In the innate immune system, cortisol dampens the inflammatory response by using its lipid soluble structure to transgress and reduce the pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. Without the dampening effect of cortisol, the inflammatory response would cause tissue damage <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. Similarly, in the adaptive immune system, cortisol molecules reduce the activity of T cells, which prevents tissue damage by decreasing the destruction of infected cells <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. Clinical populations characterized by low cortisol levels are likely to experience excessive immune responses <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>. Paradoxically, clinical populations characterized by chronically elevated cortisol levels may also experience increased inflammation via reduced GR sensitivity <span class="citation">(Maletic and Raison 2017)</span>.</p>

<h2><strong>Salivary Cortisol Laboratory Procedures</strong></h2>
<div id="biologically-active-cortisol" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Biologically Active Cortisol</strong></h3>
<p>Cortisol-binding globulin (i.e., transcortin) is a carrier protein synthesized by the liver that helps to regulate the amount of free or unbound, active, cortisol that affects peripheral cells <span class="citation">(Molina 2006)</span>. Cortisol-binding globulin acts as a cortisol buffer in that it contains approximately 90% of cortisol and replenishes the smaller free fraction of cortisol as needed, which narrowly fluctuates around 10% <span class="citation">(Mendel 1989)</span>. In this way, CBG extends the 66 minute half-life of cortisol <span class="citation">(Weitzman et al. 1971)</span>. The biologically free fraction of cortisol is partially determined by the availability of CBG, which varies as a function of its initial synthesis and as a function of its affinity with other hormones such as progesterone and aldosterone <span class="citation">(Hammond 2016)</span>. The biologically active portion of cortisol increases when such hormones are abnormally elevated because they prevent cortisol from binding onto CBG <span class="citation">(Spencer and Deak 2017)</span>. However, cortisol has the highest affinity for CBG <span class="citation">(Hammond 2016)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="salivary-cortisol-assay-procedures" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>Salivary Cortisol Assay Procedures</strong></h3>
<p>The lipid soluble biologically active portion of cortisol is found in many different cell types and is thus commonly assayed for use in biobehavioral research. Unbound cortisol is assayed from non-blood samples such as saliva, urine, hair and feces. Salivary cortisol sampling is widely used because it is noninvasive, it can be sampled in laboratory and field settings and because it is strongly correlated with the 24-hour rhythm of unbound plasma cortisol <span class="citation">(Kirschbaum and Hellhammer 1989)</span>. However, a marked dissociation between unbound cortisol in blood and salivary samples has also been reported, with salivary cortisol containing lower cortisol concentrations <span class="citation">(Hellhammer, Wüst, and Kudielka 2009; Levine et al. 2007)</span>. It is estimated that approximately 14% of salivary cortisol is bound to CBG <span class="citation">(Chu and Ekins 1988)</span>.</p>
<p>The Salivette device (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany), wherein participants chew on cotton swabs, is the most widely used collection device <span class="citation">(Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012; Groschl 2008)</span>. The Salivette device is preferred over other devices because of its ease-of-use and its effective filtering capacity <span class="citation">(Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012; Groschl 2008)</span>. At collection time, participants are commonly asked to rinse their oral cavities and chew on a cotton swab for 30 to 180 seconds <span class="citation">(Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012)</span>. Participants are also asked to refrain from eating, brushing their teeth, smoking and drinking non-water beverages 30 to 120 minutes before providing a sample <span class="citation">(Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012; Almeida, Wethington, and Kessler 2002)</span>. Nonetheless, smokers tend to have higher salivary cortisol levels than nonsmokers and oral abrasions tend to result in erroneously high salivary cortisol levels <span class="citation">(Kirschbaum, Wüst, and Strasburger 1992; Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Salivary samples are cooled at various temperatures at different stages of study procedures. In the field, participants are typically asked to store samples at 4-8 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C for a maximum of 7 days <span class="citation">(Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012)</span>. In the laboratory, samples can be stored between -20 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C and -80 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C for up to 12 months prior to centrifugation <span class="citation">(Garde and Hansen 2005; Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012)</span>. After a clear supernatant component is derived from centrifugation, immunoassay methods are used to quantify free salivary cortisol concentrations. Although radioimmunoassay methods (RIA) are most readily used, immunosorbent assay (ELISA), electrochemiluminescent assays (ECLIA) and liquid chromatographic mass spectrometry methods (LC-MSMS) are also used. Of note, salivary cortisol RIA assay methods cross-react with cortisone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol, 21-deoxycortisol, 6<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>-hydroxycortisol, prednisolone and 6<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-methylprednisolone <span class="citation">(Beko et al. 2010; Inder, Dimeski, and Russell 2012)</span>.</p>

<div id="study-rationale" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Study Rationale</strong></h2>
<p>In reviewing the literature on diurnal salivary cortisol measures, it is plausible that deriving residual standard deviations from diurnal cortisol slopes may yield a reliable estimate of cortisol dynamics. While commonly used measures of diurnal salivary cortisol provide meaningful information on HPA axis regulation, intraindividual secretory variability is not explicitly captured. Computational models of the ultradian rhythm and high-frequency sampling studies point to the importance of developing a sensitive measure of cortisol intraindividual secretory variability (cIIV).</p>
<p>Both computational models and high-frequency sampling studies demonstrate that ultradian oscillations dampen over the course of the day, with the largest oscillations occurring at the peak of the circadian rhythm and the smallest oscillations occurring at the nadir of the circadian rhythm <span class="citation">(Bhake et al. 2020; Nielsen, Laz, and Lauritzen 2017)</span>. Thus, normative salivary secretory patterns, excluding the CAR, may be characterized by low diurnal residual variability. In contrast, erratic secretory patterns, excluding the CAR, may be characterized by sporadic or high diurnal residual variability.</p>
<p>Computational models of the ultradian rhythm suggest that a normative ultradian rhythm is characterized by a tightly controlled and highly responsive dynamic system <span class="citation">(Oster et al. 2017; Walker et al. 2015)</span>. In a normative ultradian rhythm, it is likely that oscillations operate within preset thresholds at various times of day <span class="citation">(Wiener 1966)</span>. Normative secretory patterns are due to the rapid responsiveness of autoregulatory feedback components, namely GRs and MRs, in the adrenal glands and in the brain <span class="citation">(Walker et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Erratic secretory patterns may be due to hyper- or hypo-sensitivity of GRs and MRs in the feed-forward and feedback processes of the ultradian pulse <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004)</span>. For example, a system that is marked by hypo-sensitivity and is ‘slow to respond’ may result in larger than expected oscillations during the nadir of the circadian rhythm. Indeed, aging may be associated with decreased responsiveness of the HPA axis, wherein older adults experience delayed GR and MR activation and thus a lagged stress response <span class="citation">(Young, Abelson, and Lightman 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Although cIIV may not directly detect pulsatile episodes, it may provide a reliable measure of cortisol secretory dynamics in that it may be related to how tightly controlled and responsive the system is. Deriving individual residual standard deviations from predicted linear mixed model trajectories is akin to the root mean square error (RMSE) in ordinary least-squares regression models, a measure of model fit. In the context of diurnal cortisol, a better fitting model would be expected for salubrious health outcomes, whereas a poorer fitting model would be expected for adverse health outcomes. In sum, cIIV, excluding the CAR, may be conceptualized as a measure of HPA axis systemic health, with a poorer fitting model indicative of a disrupted dynamical system.</p>
<p>A few salivary cortisol studies have examined cortisol dynamics in mood disorders. Contrary to the above prediction, a recent study using a Bayesian multilevel Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model found lower variability in older depressed female adults <span class="citation">(Booij et al. 2020)</span>. However, this finding was only found in one of two samples analyzed and is qualified by a small sample size <span class="citation">(Booij et al. 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Two other studies of depressed patients used linear mixed models to test group differences (depression diagnosis vs. control &amp; bipolar diagnosis vs. control) in cortisol residual variance and autocorrelation (i.e., sample to sample variability) structures <span class="citation">(Havermans et al. 2011; Peeters, Nicolson, and Berkhof 2004)</span>. In these studies, clinical patients exhibited lower autocorrelation but did not exhibit different residual variance structures <span class="citation">(Havermans et al. 2011; Peeters, Nicolson, and Berkhof 2004)</span>. In both studies, cortisol levels were used as the dependent variable and the likelihood ratio test was used to compare models with different group-level variance and autocorrelation structures <span class="citation">(Havermans et al. 2011; Peeters, Nicolson, and Berkhof 2004)</span>. Of note, both studies reported small sample sizes, which may have rendered it difficult to obtain reliable variance component estimates <span class="citation">(Havermans et al. 2011; Peeters, Nicolson, and Berkhof 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Given the paucity of data on salivary cortisol dynamics, more studies are needed to discern meaningful conclusions. While a few studies have examined cortisol dynamics in clinical depression, studies have yet to examine cortisol dynamics in nonclinical affect presentations. Moreover, studies have yet to investigate salivary cortisol intraindividual secretory variability as a person-level predictor. Thus, the primary aim of the present study is to address these gaps in the literature.</p>
<p>A second exploratory aim is to examine whether distinct salivary cortisol profiles comprising the CAR, DCS, AUC and cIIV are associated with trait positive and negative affect. Although extant literature has demonstrated individual associations between affect and measures of salivary cortisol, studies have yet to examine associations with distinct profiles of salivary cortisol measures (i.e., similar patterns of the CAR, DCS, AUC and cIIV) and affect. It may be that particular combinations of the CAR, DCS, AUC and cIIV are better or worse for health. An initial step in this line of research is to derive distinct profiles of salivary cortisol measures and to assess their relation to positive and negative affect.</p>

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
